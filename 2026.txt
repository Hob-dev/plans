+ = Objectives
- = Completed 

Important:
Notes - try to contextualize lectures in notes of some sort

Main Quest: 
N.A.V.I. (Neuro-Augmented Volitional Input) BCI System

Fun Goals:
NixOS
NVIM
Deadlock Eternus
Final Fantasy XV on a maxed out rig
VR + Hytale (for fun)

(Current) Mission: Learn Deep Learning Terminology, CNN, Torch -> TF (TFLite) 
-> train and deploy classifier onto BCI
